“Not the blood, sir. But all of a man’s water, ultimately, belongs to his people—to his tribe. It’s a necessity when you live near the Great Flat. All water’s precious there, and the human body is composed of some seventy percent water by weight. A dead man, surely, no longer requires that water”

"We offer our sincerest condolences on the death of your brother. Perhaps the alliance of our two families will help end the treachery which took his life. Treachery which was bred on Salusa Secundus."
